# Learn Java Like an Informatics Student – Semester 1 ☕💻

This repository documents my learning journey in **Java** as a first-semester **Informatics** student at  
**Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM), Germany**.

The goal is not only to write code, but to truly **understand fundamental concepts** taught in university:  
data types, control flow, methods, OOP basics, and simple algorithms.

> Most notes and explanations are written in **Indonesian**, with some technical vocabulary in **English/German**, matching the style of university lectures.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my progress in understanding Java throughout Semester 1 at THM.
- Provide simple, clean, and well-commented code examples.
- Serve as a digital notebook to review concepts before exams.
- Help other beginners or Informatik students understand Java fundamentals.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### **1. Java Basics**
- Structure of a Java program (`class`, `main`)
- Variables, primitive data types, operators
- Basic I/O

### **2. Control Flow**
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`

### **3. Arrays & Strings**
- One-dimensional arrays
- Basic operations (searching, iteration, min/max)
- Simple string manipulation

### **4. Methods**
- Methods with/without return values
- Parameters & Java's pass-by-value concept

### **5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Creating classes & objects
- Constructors
- The `this` keyword
- Overriding `toString()`

### **6. (Optional / Coming Soon)**
- Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Basic algorithms
- More structured exercises similar to university assignments
